The parser was the hardest part of the program, getting all the structs right was extremely difficult.
I initially gave up working on this assingment as it was way beyond my level and I had too much work.
However, the extension gave me some hope that maybe I could get some points to help my graede.
I struggled the most with pointers and structs as I have not practiced enough, so I read a lot on them and that kinda helped.
It also did not help that I failed all the test cases, but thankfully i decided to ignore it for now and work on the actual shell.
Making the actual shell was not as bad as I thought as most of the code was demoed in class and I took this class before, so I used code that I previously worked on.
Redirecting is also extremely challenging. I was unable to solve it, hopefully working more on it will allow me to pass more test cases.
All that being said, I am glad to have made a valiant attempt at this assignment as it really pushed me past my limits and I gained a lot of knowledge through doing it.

The parser was the hardest part of the program. I initially gave up working on this assingment as it was way beyond my level and I had too much work.
However, the extension gave me some hope that maybe I could get some points and get a D in this class.
I struggled the most with pointers as I have not practiced enough, so I read a lot on them and that kinda helped.
Making the actual shell was not as bad as I thought as most of the code was demoed in class and I took this class before, so I used code that I previously worked on.
Redirecting is also extremely challenging. I was unable to solve it, hopefully working more on it will allow me to pass more test cases.
